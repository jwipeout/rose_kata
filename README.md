# Gilded Rose Kata in Ruby

## Introduction

This is a refactoring exercise that demonstrates important skills/concepts such as abstraction, incapsulation, dependency injection, test driven design, etc. I thought that this would highlight my design and decision making as a software engineer.

## Usage

I have created and pushed a public docker image to allow quick and easy use ```docker pull jwipeout/rose_kata```

If you are familiar with docker-compose, you can simply clone the github repo and run ```docker-compose up -d``` If you would like to volume your local computer repo to the container you can uncomment the volumes section in the docker-compose.yml and replace the ```~/code/rose_kata``` path with the path of your local computer rose_kata repo.
